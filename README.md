# vuo-photosphere
a photosphere (360 degree panorama) viewer in vuo with syphon output

### Background
[Vuo](http://vuo.org/) is a OSX only (for now) node based creative code tool.
[Photosphere](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.GoogleCamera&hl=en) is a feature of Android's stock "camera" application.

### Usage
Open the composition in Vuo editor and use the mouse to manipulate. Output will be sent as a Syphon server ready for use in any Syphon capable application (of which there are many).

Your composition can also be exported to a Mac OSX Application.

### Known Issues
Slight seam line where the texture repeats on the sphere.
